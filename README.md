# OSeMOSYS-Flextool
Integrating OSeMOSYS and Flextool energy system models. Includes transforming a OSeMOSYS model to Flextool through INES spec and running OSeMOSYS as capacity expansion model and passing these results to FlexTool, where the flexibility of the new system can be tested.

# Status

NOT FUNCTIONAL!

Still missing Osemosys to ines transformation parameters and result passing between models.
Better documentation is done, once the workflow is functional.
